# Kratylos Context-Free Grammar Manipulator
>No man of sense can put himself and his soul under the control of names... You must consider courageously and thoroughly and not accept anything carelessly.  
  
This is the documentation for the *Kratylos Context-Free Grammar Manipulator*, a tool meant for designing, analyzing and manipulating [context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). This documentation was written with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and is best viewed with it. 

This documentation function is two-fold: It serves as a documentation for users of *Kratylos*, as well as a small knowledge database. Each folder contains a file called `Index(.md)` that contains a short overview of all contents in that folder.
