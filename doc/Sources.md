2. [Analyzing Context-Free Grammars Using an Incremental SAT Solver](http://users.ics.aalto.fi/kepa/publications/AxelssonHeljankoLange-ICALP08.pdf): "We consider bounded versions of undecidable problems about context-free languages which restrict the domain of words to some finite length: inclusion, intersection, universality, equivalence, and ambiguity. These are in (co)-NP and thus solvable by a reduction to the (un-)satisfiability problem for propositional logic. We present such encodings – fully utilizing the power of incrementat SAT solvers – prove correctness and validate this approach with benchmarks"
