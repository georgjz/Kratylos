# Kratylos Context-Free Grammar Manipulator

Graphical tool for designing, analyzing and manipulating [context-free grammars][cfg].

**This repository is heavy WIP**. Currently, I'm building a knowledge database about context-free grammars. To view it, open the directory `doc` with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and start at the top-level file `Index`. Alternatively, just use a plain text editor, as the files are written in plain markdown. But I make heavy use of Latex for rendering mathematical notation.

Once the knowledge database is complete, the implementation using [typed][typedracket] [Racket][racket] will be found in the `src` directory. Currently, it only holds some sad skeleton code.

For the sake of your own sanity, ignore everything in `playground`.
